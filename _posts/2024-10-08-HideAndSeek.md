Recently, I watched a professional hide and seek competition and it was spectacular to see the creativity and effort of the participants.

The competition had 1 seeker and 6 hiders, and the game would be played in selected locations, that can range from abandoned schools to in-operation museums.

The hiders were given until sunset to hide in the venue, with the option of using props. When the sun sets, the seeker would be given 1 hour to find all the hiders.

If the hiders were not found, they would win a cash prize. For hiders that did not use props, they would be rewarded with double the cash prize. On the other hand, the seeker would win the cash prize of the hiders that were found. As such, the nature of the game was very intense and exciting.

Some of the more memorable moments included the hiders doing high-elements to avoid detection, hiders deliberately leaving honeypots behind, and multiple hiders hiding in the very same spot. These strategies put the skills of the seeker to the test, and it was thrilling to see how the seeker would scrutinise every detail and logically deduce the possible hiding spots. 

Overall, it is a great show to watch and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a mix of strategy and deduction.
